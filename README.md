Ciara Ugas-Moy  
# Chatroom built in Java  
(see project folder)
# Requirements:
- A server that can handle multiple simultaneous clients
- Handle sending data back and forth more so than just a simple string
- Gracefully handle disconnects and server shutdowns
- Provide the ability for the users to do something
## Milestone 1:
- Server can be started via IDE or command line and listen for connections
- Client can be started via IDE or command line and connect to the running server
- Client can send messages to the server
- Server can broadcast messages to all connected clients of a particular Room
- Server will implement the concept of “Rooms”
- Clients will have some sort of identifier to show who sent each message
- Clients can disconnect and reconnect without crashing the server
- The Server terminating should not terminate the clients as well
- Clients should receive a disconnected message
## Milestone 2:
- Server will have the functionality to switch users between “Rooms”  
(i.e., all start in “Lobby”, but can then create or join existing rooms to be with a particular group)
Rooms will not have cross communication
- Following the payload concept begin implementing some of the core functionality
- Chat system - Wrap messages in payload so extra data can be sent/received  
I.e., Payload { message: “text”, sender: “username”}  
- Create a server-side function the processes message commands (i.e., /roll, /flip) and broadcasts the result to all clients  
/roll will handle two different formats  
  Format 1: /roll 0 - X or 1 - X   
  Example: /roll 100   
  Format 2: /roll #d#  
  Example: /roll 2d6  
/flip will return heads or tails (like a coin toss)
  - Create a server-side function that processes messages to change text display that’s broadcasted to all clients (for this milestone just show the altered text symbols, we won’t be able to see the effects until Milestone 3)
  - Bold
  - Italics
  - Color (at least Red, Green, Blue options or code to support color hex codes)
  - Underline  
Note: Having the user type out html tags is not valid for this feature, instead treat it like WhatsApp, Discord, Markdown, etc
Note: Each text trigger must wrap the text that you want to affect
## Milestone 3:
- Create a UI Page/Panel for connecting to the server
  - Username (don’t allow spaces)
  - Host
  - Port
- Create a UI Page for the chatroom
  - List of users in the room
  - Text area for the chat history
  - Input field for typing messages
  - Button for sending messages
- Pressing enter should also submit the button if the input field isn’t empty
- Results from /flip and /roll appear in a different format than regular chat text
- Custom text display functions appear correctly in the chat area (i.e., last feature of Milestone 2)
- Messages that precede with @username will send the message privately to the user denoted by the username
- The writer and the receiver are the only two that will receive the message from the server  
It’s not valid to just hide it on the client-side (i.e., data must not be sent from the server)
The following commands will be implemented server-side
- mute username  
Prevents the user from receiving messages from the target user
- unmute username  
Allows the user to receive messages from the target user (if they were previously muted)
## Milestone 4:
- Client can export the chat history of  their current session (client-side)
- Client’s mute list will persist across sessions (server-side) Based on username match
- Clients will receive a message when they get muted/unmuted by another user  
(i.e., Bob muted you)  
This message should only be sent if muted becomes unmuted or unmuted becomes mute, it’s not an opportunity to create a spam mechanism
The user list should update per the status of each user
- Muted users appear grayed out
- Last person to send a message gets highlighted
